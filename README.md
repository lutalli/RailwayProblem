# Railway Problem

This repo contains stuff that I want to store for a project I'm working on in my school. It's a mathematical problem which is about the classification of different types of *railway systems* that are strictly defined. A particularly central elemnt there is the *switch*, which has three *gates*. For a detailed formulation of the problem, see PDF (in German).

The Python script is a brutal force solver for the problem. It simply lists out all connection possiblities of given switches and classify them.
